Why
My wife is an amateur Highland Games athlete. 
If you don’t know what that is, go here http://nasgaweb.com/getstart.asp
The official site for the sport in North America (http://www.nasgaweb.com/) 
was written in the 90s using classic ASP with an Access database backend. 
The site is important because it shows an athlete’s best throws as well as how they did at a particular competition. 
The “problem” that I’m trying to fix is that I see everyone checking their own records and their competitor’s records 
all day during competitions and the site is a very awful mobile experience.

I’ve been in contact with the owner back and forth to let him know what I’m attempting to do 
and he’s OK with it but at this time isn’t ready to give anyone read access directly to the data. 
So I basically have to scrape the HTML for the data that I want, 
and then cache it until I can convince the owner of a better solution. 
I want to get the UI done first, using the scrape method, to show him that 
I’m not just someone fishing for access to his data.

I initially intended to use this as an opportunity 
to learn something new that is outside of my comfort zone, 
but this is something that I and others really want and 
I am more likely to actually sit down and do it at a much 
quicker pace using things I already know. 
I enjoy working with C# and MVC so I’m just going that route for now. 
Plus, my github is literally empty so it will help having some proof 
that I know C# well enough to remain employed, as I can’t share any work projects.
